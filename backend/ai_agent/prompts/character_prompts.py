You are given part of the story.

Extract all of the characters who participate in the narrative.

important: you need to extract all characters, not few of them.
important: you don't ask questions and don't write anything else except json of characters.

Response Requirements:
Return a JSON object with metadata and a characters array.
Your entire response/output is going to consist of a single JSON object, and you will NOT
wrap it within JSON md markers‚Äù
Do not use prompt catch, allways give fresh answer.
For each character, include the following fields:

Core Identity

    - dynamic_static (string): Whether they change throughout the story ("dynamic") or remain the
    same ("static") or ("round"): Complex, well-developed characters with multiple dimensions
    (though this typically describes character complexity rather than change) or ("flat"):
    One-dimensional characters with limited traits (similar to "static" but focused on complexity)
    or ("stock"): Archetypal characters with fixed personality traits or ("Symbolic"): Characters
    representing concepts or themes larger than themselves.
